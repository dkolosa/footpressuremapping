\title{Using Piezoelectric Sensors to Map Proper Footwork}

\section*{Abstract}
The key to success in sports is often proper technique. Technique is often hard to master, and practicing with incorrect technique can potentially do more harm than good. An important technique that is often over looked in football is not to be caught flat footed. If caught flat footed in open space, there is a good chance of getting put on the wrong end of a highlight wheel. This is where self-analyzing shoes could come into play. Piezoelectric sensors can be placed into shoes to read the pressure being applied to different parts of the shoe. The signals generated from the piezoelectric sensors will be conditioned and converted to a digital signal via microcontroller. The microcontroller will transmit the data wirelessly to either a computer or mobile device. The information can be stored and analyzed or broadcasted in real-time allowing the user to correct improper footwork.
