This project uses piezoelectric sensors to map the pressure distribution on a foot. This project is made up of two parts: The signal processing using an Arduino microcontroller, and companion android app.

Project Structure:
master: holds all folders that are part of the stable(working) branch of the project
staging: Features that are mostly working but not yet ready to moved to due to code styling or known bugs
Arduino: any and all feature(s) that are being worked on in the MCU or Arduino side of the project
Android: and and all feature(s) that are being worked on in the app side of the project
